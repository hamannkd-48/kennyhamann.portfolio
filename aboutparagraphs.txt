I design identities the way I shape music: with attention, intention, and emotional clarity.

I’m Kenny, a musician and graphic designer shaped by my adoration for nature, my ambition, and the quiet space just before a downbeat. I came of age at places like the Cazadero Music Camp, where redwoods older than memory stood guard over rehearsal halls and cabins. There, I learned that art —whether sonic or visual— has the power to gather strangers into community and make the world briefly fall away.

Cazadero taught me how to transform pressure into purpose. Performing trained me to replace anxiety with focus: how to stand in front of others with clarity and conviction. As a counselor, I discovered the parallel between music and leadership: guiding younger musicians toward confidence felt remarkably similar to guiding an audience through a symphony. That instinct —to lead with vision while listening closely— now shapes both my musicianship and my design practice.

As a graphic designer, I work with small businesses to build and rebuild brands from the ground up. Logos, color palettes, typography systems, imagery, and web presence are not just aesthetic decisions; they are translations of identity. I approach branding the way I approach an ensemble score: understanding the core theme, identifying tension and harmony, and shaping every detail so the final expression feels cohesive and intentional. If a brand cannot clearly communicate who it is and whom it serves, then it hasn’t truly been designed—it has only been decorated.

Music trained my eye as much as my ear. Conducting draws me because it exists at the intersection of precision and emotion: stepping onto a stage empty-handed yet shaping the sound of many. Design requires the same balance. I listen first—learning a client’s story, values, and aspirations—then translate that vision into visual language that others can immediately feel. Leadership, in both fields, begins with attention.

This portfolio is a reflection of that philosophy: disciplined creativity, emotional awareness, and a commitment to clarity. Whether I’m shaping an ensemble’s phrasing or redefining a company’s visual identity, I am searching for the same thing—a moment when everything aligns, when intention becomes expression, and when people feel understood.
