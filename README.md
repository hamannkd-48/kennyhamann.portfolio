Welcome to my personal site. All graphic design work that is advertised is my own.


# If You're Seeing This On The Web, LET ME KNOW it's an error

Live Site: https://www.hamann.earth

This is my professional design portfolio built to showcase brand identity, logo design, and web projects for small businesses.
I specialize in creating cohesive visual systems — logos, color palettes, typography, imagery, and responsive web experiences.
This site reflects my approach to clarity, storytelling, and intentional design.


## Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates:
- Brand identity systems
- Logo redesign case studies
- Custom-coded website abilities
- Responsive layout techniques
- Clean, accessible front-end structure


## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript EMAScript 2025
- GitHub Pages
- Custom domain configuration


## Folder Structure

/assets — images and media  
style.css and extras.css — stylesheets  
/index.html — homepage  
Each .html page still does have a lot of embedded <style> script (tbh most of it is kinda redundant and I need to clean it out)
